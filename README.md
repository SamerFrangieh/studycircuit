# Student Collaboration Platform

## About The Project

The Student Collaboration Platform is a web-based application designed to match students based on their academic profiles, including languages they know, their majors, and courses taken. This enables students to find peers with similar academic interests or requirements, facilitating collaboration on projects, study groups, and peer support in school activities.
